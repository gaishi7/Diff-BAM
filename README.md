# Diff-BAM: A Generalized Adaptive Diffusion Model for Cultural Heritage Image Inpainting
This study makes the following contributionsï¼š

Significantly reducing the computational overhead and inference delay of diffusion model by dynamically adjusting the computational path of denoising process.

The Gaussian fuzzy fusion module is embedded in U-Net to solve the complex edge transition problem of cultural heritage images.

We created a large-scale dataset of Thang_ka.
## Dataset
The core data for this study comes from our carefully constructed large-scale, high-quality Thang_ka image dataset, download link below:
